# These are here because we used to automatically create magic blocks under
# certain conditions to act as mob spawners
#
# However, I have decided this causes a lot of clutter, since magic blocks are not stored
# with their chunks (would be nice if they were), and also causes
# issues when adding and then later removing the example
#
# So now they will all get automatically removed on startup.
